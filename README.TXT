TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system, version #2.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a second version of the technical support system 
example. It is an intermediate version intended to demonstrate the first
few changes discussed in this book chapter.


To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

24: A HashMap is a reiteration of a Map and an ArrayList that is used to save and view specific things in a

Maps and has a capacity limit that causes it to stop working if the HashMap contains too much.
25: It uses an intenger and a float as its parameter. The methods that use it are containsKey, 
containsValue, size, values, entrySet and keySet. I do not think the same type could be used for both of its
parameters.
26: You either use size() or values().

29: It adds a new key with a new value.
30: You use containsKey(Object key).
31: It returns null.
32: You use a for loop that uses keySet to prevent repeating previous keys, then put print inside the for loop.
